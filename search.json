    "text": "A lot has happened in the 413 days since my last blog post.\nWith my colleagues, I shut down Agile in September. With my family, I packed up my house in October and moved to Norway in November. With my new colleagues, I found my feet in Equinor in December, and that adventure continues.\nHaving started my career as a geologist, then reconfigured as a geophysicist, I‚Äôm proud to call myself a developer today. I still have tons to learn about maintaining large projects in an enterprise setting, but I do make things and I consider that to be the killer feature of any hacker.\nA few people have asked me what it‚Äôs like to have a boss again, or work inside a big corporation. But really, it‚Äôs not that different from working with corporate clients. I still have a lot of self-determination, thanks to the progressive style of the awesome team I work in, and the only thing I really miss is being able to decide for myself that I‚Äôd like to spend $10k on a hackathon.\nLife outside work is full of hikes and bikes, far-flung fjords and cosy cabins. My Norwegian is a bit rusty (my wife and I lived here in the nineties) but basically functional. We found a house to live in, though it did require some downsizing.\nIn case you hadn‚Äôt noticed, this blog post is more of a postcard to the many friends and co-conspirators I‚Äôve completely failed to keep in touch with. With luck, the coming months and years will provide many opportunities to catch up in person.\nFor now though‚Ä¶ the blog is back! Scien‚úñÔ∏èlab is here üöÄ"

    "text": "The Software Underground ‚Äî a free chat group, a community, a movement ‚Äî¬†is moving to the Mattermost platform. As of right now, it lives at mattermost.softwareunderground.org.\nAfter a little over 8 years on Slack, we have taken the decision to move to the open-source Mattermost software (note, that link is only for the software, not for our instance of it). We are hosting it ourselves in Hetzner‚Äôs cloud (based in Finland), which means we own our own data‚Ä¶ and maybe have a little more control over our destiny.\nApart from being open source, there are some other cool features of Mattermost, compared to Slack:\n\nFull support for Markdown, plus LaTeX equations.\nSyntax highlighted code blocks.\nThe concept of Teams, allowing us to host subcommunities.\n\nOh yeah, and it will cost us about a third of what we were previously spending on Slack üí∏¬†that is, until they doubled our payments in September when apparently they changed how they count ‚Äòactive members‚Äô. Even with the 85% non-profit discount, Slack was simply too expensive. And some people were not comfortable with its ownership and general direction. For example, it recently introduced a 90-day message lifetime for teams on the free tier, all but obviating its use for smaller communities (who already had a 10,000 message limit).\nIf you‚Äôve been looking for somewhere to hang out and chat ‚Äî¬†or even just to lurk and learn ‚Äî¬†about the digital subsurface, then Software Underground might be for you. It‚Äôs full of coders, people learning to code, earth scientists, and people learning to earth science. Check it out."

If you have others, drop me a line and I‚Äôll do my best to answer them.\nüß© The theme will be Integration, which you can interpret any way you like. For example, you might look at integrating datasets, or numerical simulations, or turbine components, or power markets, or even project teams.\nüè¢ I‚Äôm stoked about the venue, DIGS, at which I recently had the pleasure of running another (private) hackathon. If the recent news of WeWork‚Äôs bankruptcy got you down about coworking, then DIGS should lift you back up again. It seems to be smashing it for the Trondheim startup community, and has room left over for events.\nüôå Many thanks to John Olav Gi√¶ver Tande, Konstanze K√∂lle and Daniel Albert at SINTEF, for the collaboration on this event. And huge thanks to Equinor for supporting the hackathon financially.\n\n‚Ä† You don‚Äôt have to code, there are lots of ways to take part."

    "text": "People with a lot of expertise (I don‚Äôt like the word ‚Äòexpert‚Äô) can help others learn and improve by writing. As a bonus, the act of writing reflexively sharpens the expertise. Everyone wins!\nHowever, if you ask someone with great experience and theoretical insight to write a how to wiki page or best practice document, there‚Äôs a good chance it will be 3000 words long, or even shatter into seven 3000-word-long sub-articles. There will probably be equations. Code, if you‚Äôre lucky. References. Valuable documentation of a difficult task, for sure‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶but completely inappropriate for 90% of use cases. Most people, most of the time, can‚Äôt absorb thousands of words right now. They see the wall of text and immediately smash that back button.\nThe challenge of reducing important ideas to a couple of paragraphs and some bullet points is too much for some. It‚Äôs ‚Äúdumbing down‚Äù, ‚Äúdiluting‚Äù, ‚Äúoversimplifying‚Äù, or pandering to ‚Äúthe lowest common denominator‚Äù. The target audience sometimes participates in this notion with requests to, ‚ÄúExplain it like I‚Äôm 5‚Äù.\nThis is a horrible misunderstanding. Simplistic content for dumb people with childlike vocabularies is not what is being asked for. There are lots of reasons other brilliant people with experience and insight want approachable content sometimes:\n\nThey only have a few minutes right now.\nThey are new to this specific topic.\nThe topic is not a critical issue for them.\nThey are just curious.\nThey just needed a refresher.\nThey are looking for something to link to.\nThey are trying to help someone else.\n\nIt‚Äôs possible that large language models like ChatGPT are especially good at this task of summarization. But I believe it‚Äôs a skill worth honing, if not for writing then for speaking. If you learn to see the loss of precision as a gain in signal strength, perhaps the tradeoff will seem less costly.\nThe result: more smart people will find and read your ideas, and get the help they were looking for."

    "text": "Hackathons aren‚Äôt what they used to be. I think they‚Äôre even better.\nThe golden age of hackathons was 2010 to 20-COVID. Before 2010 I think they were mostly niche Silicon Valley affairs; Agile ran its first hack in 2013 so that‚Äôs when they started for me. I ran 11 of them in 2019‚Ä¶ And it really did end with COVID: I was at an event in Kuala Lumpur when COVID lockdown started.\nHackathons never went away completely, but they definitely dimmed. Happily, they seem to be coming back in style, and while the concept is perhaps not quite as exciting or cool as it was, in some ways the events are better. The frenetic commercial energy of Digital Transformation has faded. The hackers, at least in the subsurface domain, are much more savvy: there‚Äôs data everywhere and everyone knows what an API is. There are far more packages and tools to choose from (with ChatGPT to find them). It‚Äôs become easier to take time out from the office. And while many of the folks who wanted or needed to find their digital feet have achieved their goals, the end of petroleum looms ever larger and I sense that more people see opportunity in it.\nI‚Äôm on my way home from a hackathon right now, my first one for about a year. It was wonderful, just like always. Lots of first-timers, which I love to see, and lots of brilliant ideas. It‚Äôs absolutely the best possible way to spend time with colleagues. If you haven‚Äôt experienced it, you should organize one at your place of work. Here‚Äôs how. Go on, I dare you üöÄ"
