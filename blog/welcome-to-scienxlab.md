**A lot has happened in the 413 days since [my last blog post](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2022/8/29/a-machine-learning-safety-net).**

With my colleagues, I shut down [Agile](https://agilescientific.com) in September. With my family, I packed up my house in October and moved to Norway in November. With my new colleagues, I found my feet in [Equinor](https://equinor.com) in December, and that adventure continues.

Having started my career as a geologist, then reconfigured as a geophysicist, I'm proud to call myself _a developer_ today. I still have tons to learn about maintaining large projects in an enterprise setting, but I do make things and I consider that to be the killer feature of any hacker.

A few people have asked me what it's like to have a boss again, or work inside a big corporation. But really, it's not that different from working with corporate clients. I still have a lot of self-determination, thanks to the progressive style of the awesome team I work in, and the only thing I really miss is being able to decide for myself that I'd like to spend $10k on a hackathon.  

Life outside work is full of hikes and bikes, far-flung fjords and cosy cabins. My Norwegian is a bit rusty (my wife and I lived here in the nineties) but basically functional. We found a house to live in, though it did require some downsizing.

In case you hadn't noticed, this blog post is more of a postcard to the many friends and co-conspirators I've completely failed to keep in touch with. With luck, the coming months and years will provide many opportunities to catch up in person.

**For now though... the blog is back! Scien‚úñÔ∏èlab is here üöÄ**
