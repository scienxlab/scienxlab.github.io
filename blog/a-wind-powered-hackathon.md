**If you like hackathons, love solving difficult problems, and have a laptop and a good winter coat, then start getting excited!**

üí® I'm thrilled to announce a new social coding<span style="color:purple">‚Ä†</span> event, happening in Trondheim, Norway, on 15 & 16 January 2024, and this one is all about offshore wind energy.

<div style="text-align: center"><p>**[Find out more and sign up](https://www.deepwind.no/deepwind-hackathon/)**</p></div>

‚òùÔ∏è Sign up is free, and there's a FAQ on that page to answer your questions. If you have others, [drop me a line](mailto:hello@scienxlab.com) and I'll do my best to answer them.

üß© The theme will be **Integration**, which you can interpret any way you like. For example, you might look at integrating datasets, or numerical simulations, or turbine components, or power markets, or even project teams.

üè¢ I'm stoked about the venue, [DIGS](https://meshcommunity.com/hubs/digs/), at which I recently had the pleasure of running another (private) hackathon. If the recent news of [WeWork's bankruptcy](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231115-after-weworks-bankruptcy-what-is-the-future-of-coworking) got you down about coworking, then DIGS should lift you back up again. It seems to be smashing it for the Trondheim startup community, and has room left over for events.

üôå Many thanks to John Olav Gi√¶ver Tande, Konstanze K√∂lle and Daniel Albert at SINTEF, for the collaboration on this event. And huge thanks to Equinor for supporting the hackathon financially.
