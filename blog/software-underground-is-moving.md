[The Software Underground](https://softwareunderground.org/) â€” a free chat group, a community, a movement â€”Â is moving to the Mattermost platform. As of right now, it lives at [**mattermost.softwareunderground.org**](https://mattermost.softwareunderground.org/).

After a little over 8 years on Slack, we have taken the decision to move to the open-source [Mattermost software](https://mattermost.com/) (note, that link is only for the software, not for our instance of it). We are hosting it ourselves in [Hetzner's cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/) (based in Finland), which means we own our own data... and maybe have a little more control over our destiny.

Apart from being open source, there are some other cool features of Mattermost, compared to Slack:

- Full support for Markdown, plus LaTeX equations.
- Syntax highlighted code blocks.
- The concept of _Teams_, allowing us to host subcommunities.

Oh yeah, and it will cost us about a third of what we were previously spending on Slack ðŸ’¸Â that is, until they doubled our payments in September when apparently they changed how they count 'active members'. Even with the 85% non-profit discount, Slack was simply too expensive. And some people were not comfortable with [its ownership](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55154326) and general direction. For example, it recently introduced a 90-day message lifetime for teams on the free tier, all but obviating its use for smaller communities (who already had a 10,000 message limit).

If you've been looking for somewhere to hang out and chat â€”Â or even just to lurk and learn â€”Â about the digital subsurface, then Software Underground might be for you. It's full of coders, people learning to code, earth scientists, and people learning to earth science. [**Check it out.**](https://mattermost.softwareunderground.org/)
