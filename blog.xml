<p>🤖 <strong>This week, seven teams of scientists and data scientists collaborated to explore ideas in large language modeling applied to a large new open dataset. Here’s what happened.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npd.no/en/force/">The FORCE consortium</a>, which has hosted hackathons and data science contests before (read <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2018/9/27/force-ml-hackathon-project-round-up">this</a> and <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2019/10/11/force-ml-2019-project-round-up">that</a>), hosted another groundbreaking event last week — <a href="https://www.npd.no/en/force/events/in-person--the-npd-language-modelling-hackathon-2023/">the NPD language modeling hackathon</a>. The event took place at the NPD in Stavanger, Norway, on 29 &amp; 30 November, and 1 December 2023.</p>
<p>As in past years, the event was organized by a small team coordinated by <strong>Peter Bormann</strong> (ConocoPhillips), who not only believes passionately in the importance of open collaboration but is committed to acting on that belief 🙌 Scroll down for the rest of the organizational credits.</p>
<p>One major feature of this event was the large new dataset the team has assembled. This contains almost three million pages of text from various reports published by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, <a href="https://www.nlog.nl/en">Netherlands Oil and Gas</a> and <a href="https://www.nstauthority.co.uk">the UK North Sea Transition Authority</a>. It will soon be published under <a href="https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/2.0">the NLOD 2.0 licence</a>, and should be an exciting resource for the community; we just want to make sure we have taken reasonable steps to protect people’s privacy before publishing it.</p>
<section id="projects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>Here’s a very quick rundown of the teams that formed at what I believe was the first public LLM-based hackathon in Norway or in the energy sector (AkerBP <a href="https://akerbp.com/en/aker-bp-hackathon-2023-a-celebration-of-data-science/">ran one of their own</a> a few weeks ago):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anonymizers</strong> — Masking personally identifiable information in public datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Embedding enthusiasts</strong> — Fine-tuning an embeddings model, using cleaner data.</li>
<li><strong>Zero-shot chatbots</strong> — What kind of questions can chatbots answer about the dataset?</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge-graphers</strong> — Extracting a knowledge graph and providing it to chatbots.</li>
<li><strong>Q&amp;A generators</strong> — Generating question-answer pairs for fine-tuning Q&amp;A chatbots.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata extractors</strong> — Automatically pulling metadata from the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow I will put up another post describing the projects in more detail. <a href="../../blog/force-hackathon-projects.html">When it’s up, you can click here to read it!</a></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="credits">Credits</h2>
<p>It takes a community of organizers to pull off a community event like this. Here’s a probably incomplete list, apologies if I missed anyone (<a href="mailto:hello@scienxlab.org">drop me a line!</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jesse Lord</strong>, (<a href="https://kadme.com">Kadme</a> and <a href="https://npd.fabriqai.com">Fabriq</a>) for the dataset, which will soon be released under an open license.</li>
<li><strong>Lukas Mosser</strong>, (<a href="https://akerbp.com/en/">AkerBP</a>) for the starter notebook and know-how.</li>
<li><strong>Paul Cleverley</strong>, <a href="https://infosciencetechnologies.com">Infoscience</a> for the named entity tags.</li>
<li><strong>Eirik Haughom</strong> and <strong>Frode Odinsen</strong>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> for the in-event Azure support.</li>
<li><strong>The NPD</strong>, especially <strong>Janke Ro</strong> and those involved in FORCE.</li>
<li>It was my privilege to facilitate the proceedings, a job I am ill-suited for but enjoy anyway 😅 Thank you to Peter for the opportunity!</li>

  <title>A wind-powered hackathon</title>
  <dc:creator>Matt Hall</dc:creator>
  <link>https://scienxlab.org/blog/a-wind-powered-hackathon.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>If you like hackathons, love solving difficult problems, and have a laptop and a good winter coat, then start getting excited!</strong></p>
<p>💨 I’m thrilled to announce a new social coding<span style="color:purple">†</span> event, happening in Trondheim, Norway, on 15 &amp; 16 January 2024, and this one is all about offshore wind energy.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.deepwind.no/deepwind-hackathon/">Find out more and sign up</a></strong>
</p>
</div>
<p>☝️ Sign up is free, and there’s a FAQ on that page to answer your questions. If you have others, <a href="mailto:hello@scienxlab.com">drop me a line</a> and I’ll do my best to answer them.</p>
<p>🧩 The theme will be <strong>Integration</strong>, which you can interpret any way you like. For example, you might look at integrating datasets, or numerical simulations, or turbine components, or power markets, or even project teams.</p>
<p>🏢 I’m stoked about the venue, <a href="https://meshcommunity.com/hubs/digs/">DIGS</a>, at which I recently had the pleasure of running another (private) hackathon. If the recent news of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231115-after-weworks-bankruptcy-what-is-the-future-of-coworking">WeWork’s bankruptcy</a> got you down about coworking, then DIGS should lift you back up again. It seems to be smashing it for the Trondheim startup community, and has room left over for events.</p>
<p>🙌 Many thanks to John Olav Giæver Tande, Konstanze Kölle and Daniel Albert at SINTEF, for the collaboration on this event. And huge thanks to Equinor for supporting the hackathon financially.</p>

  <title>I’m not stupid I’m just…</title>
  <dc:creator>Matt Hall</dc:creator>
  <link>https://scienxlab.org/blog/im-not-stupid-im-just.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>People with a lot of expertise (I <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2013/6/19/expert-culture-is-bad-for-you.html">don’t like</a> the word ‘expert’) can help others learn and improve by writing. As a bonus, the act of writing reflexively sharpens the expertise. Everyone wins!</p>
<p>However, if you ask someone with great experience and theoretical insight to write a <em>how to</em> wiki page or <em>best practice</em> document, there’s a good chance it will be 3000 words long, or even shatter into seven 3000-word-long sub-articles. There will probably be equations. Code, if you’re lucky. References. Valuable documentation of a difficult task, for sure…</p>
<p>…but completely inappropriate for 90% of use cases. Most people, most of the time, can’t absorb thousands of words right now. They see the wall of text and immediately smash that back button.</p>
<p>The challenge of reducing important ideas to a couple of paragraphs and some bullet points is too much for some. It’s “dumbing down”, “diluting”, “oversimplifying”, or pandering to “the lowest common denominator”. The target audience sometimes participates in this notion with requests to, “Explain it like I’m 5”.</p>
<p>This is a horrible misunderstanding. Simplistic content for dumb people with childlike vocabularies is not what is being asked for. There are lots of reasons other brilliant people with experience and insight want approachable content sometimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>They only have a few minutes right now.</li>
<li>They are new to this specific topic.</li>
<li>The topic is not a critical issue for them.</li>
<li>They are just curious.</li>
<li>They just needed a refresher.</li>
<li>They are looking for something to link to.</li>
<li>They are trying to help someone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible that large language models like ChatGPT are especially good at this task of summarization. But I believe it’s a skill worth honing, if not for writing then for speaking. If you learn to see the loss of precision as a gain in signal strength, perhaps the tradeoff will seem less costly.</p>
<p><strong>The result: more smart people will find and read your ideas, and get the help they were looking for.</strong></p>

  <title>Software Underground is moving</title>
  <dc:creator>Matt Hall</dc:creator>
  <link>https://scienxlab.org/blog/software-underground-is-moving.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><a href="https://softwareunderground.org/">The Software Underground</a> — a free chat group, a community, a movement —&nbsp;is moving to the Mattermost platform. As of right now, it lives at <a href="https://mattermost.softwareunderground.org/"><strong>mattermost.softwareunderground.org</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After a little over 8 years on Slack, we have taken the decision to move to the open-source <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost software</a> (note, that link is only for the software, not for our instance of it). We are hosting it ourselves in <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner’s cloud</a> (based in Finland), which means we own our own data… and maybe have a little more control over our destiny.</p>
<p>Apart from being open source, there are some other cool features of Mattermost, compared to Slack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full support for Markdown, plus LaTeX equations.</li>
<li>Syntax highlighted code blocks.</li>
<li>The concept of <em>Teams</em>, allowing us to host subcommunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, and it will cost us about a third of what we were previously spending on Slack 💸&nbsp;that is, until they doubled our payments in September when apparently they changed how they count ‘active members’. Even with the 85% non-profit discount, Slack was simply too expensive. And some people were not comfortable with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55154326">its ownership</a> and general direction. For example, it recently introduced a 90-day message lifetime for teams on the free tier, all but obviating its use for smaller communities (who already had a 10,000 message limit).</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for somewhere to hang out and chat —&nbsp;or even just to lurk and learn —&nbsp;about the digital subsurface, then Software Underground might be for you. It’s full of coders, people learning to code, earth scientists, and people learning to earth science. <a href="https://mattermost.softwareunderground.org/"><strong>Check it out.</strong></a></p>

  <title>Hackathon season</title>
  <dc:creator>Matt Hall</dc:creator>
  <link>https://scienxlab.org/blog/hackathon-season.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p><strong>Hackathons aren’t what they used to be. I think they’re even better.</strong></p>
<p>The golden age of hackathons was 2010 to 20-COVID. Before 2010 I think they were mostly niche Silicon Valley affairs; Agile <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2013/10/2/what-we-built-at-the-weekend.html">ran its first hack in 2013</a> so that’s when they started for me. I ran 11 of them in 2019… And it really did end with COVID: I was at an event in Kuala Lumpur when COVID lockdown started.</p>
<p>Hackathons never went away completely, but they definitely dimmed. Happily, they seem to be coming back in style, and while the concept is perhaps not quite as exciting or cool as it was, in some ways the events are better. The frenetic commercial energy of Digital Transformation has faded. The hackers, at least in the subsurface domain, are much more savvy: there’s data everywhere and everyone knows what an API is. There are far more packages and tools to choose from (with ChatGPT to find them). It’s become easier to take time out from the office. And while many of the folks who wanted or needed to find their digital feet have achieved their goals, the end of petroleum looms ever larger and I sense that more people see opportunity in it.</p>
<p>I’m on my way home from a hackathon right now, my first one for about a year. It was wonderful, just like always. Lots of first-timers, which I love to see, and lots of brilliant ideas. It’s absolutely the best possible way to spend time with colleagues. If you haven’t experienced it, you should organize one at your place of work. <a href="https://hackmd.io/dUYWLDDISnOwjEVAwdZKJg">Here’s how.</a> Go on, I dare you 🚀</p>
<section id="an-invitation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-invitation">An invitation</h2>
<p>If you’re not quite ready to host one, come and experience one instead. <a href="https://www.npd.no/en/force/events/in-person--the-npd-language-modelling-hackathon-2023/">The FORCE Language Modeling Hackathon</a> is happening in Stavanger, Norway, on 30 November and 1 December 2023. I’m stoked to be hosting, with Peter Bormann organizing. The plan is to fine-tune some language models with open subsurface data from the Norwegian shelf. <strong>What would you ask a virtual assistant that has read everything about <em>your</em> project?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A lot has happened in the 413 days since <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2022/8/29/a-machine-learning-safety-net">my last blog post</a>.</strong></p>
<p>With my colleagues, I shut down <a href="https://agilescientific.com">Agile</a> in September. With my family, I packed up my house in October and moved to Norway in November. With my new colleagues, I found my feet in <a href="https://equinor.com">Equinor</a> in December, and that adventure continues.</p>
<p>Having started my career as a geologist, then reconfigured as a geophysicist, I’m proud to call myself <em>a developer</em> today. I still have tons to learn about maintaining large projects in an enterprise setting, but I do make things and I consider that to be the killer feature of any hacker.</p>
<p>A few people have asked me what it’s like to have a boss again, or work inside a big corporation. But really, it’s not that different from working with corporate clients. I still have a lot of self-determination, thanks to the progressive style of the awesome team I work in, and the only thing I really miss is being able to decide for myself that I’d like to spend $10k on a hackathon.</p>
<p>Life outside work is full of hikes and bikes, far-flung fjords and cosy cabins. My Norwegian is a bit rusty (my wife and I lived here in the nineties) but basically functional. We found a house to live in, though it did require some downsizing.</p>
<p>In case you hadn’t noticed, this blog post is more of a postcard to the many friends and co-conspirators I’ve completely failed to keep in touch with. With luck, the coming months and years will provide many opportunities to catch up in person.</p>
<p><strong>For now though… the blog is back! Scien✖️lab is here 🚀</strong></p>
