  <title>Hackathon season</title>

<p><strong>Hackathons aren‚Äôt what they used to be. I think they‚Äôre even better.</strong></p>
<p>The golden age of hackathons was 2010 to 20-COVID. Before 2010 I think they were mostly niche Silicon Valley affairs; Agile <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2013/10/2/what-we-built-at-the-weekend.html">ran its first hack in 2013</a> so that‚Äôs when they started for me. I ran 11 of them in 2019‚Ä¶ And it really did end with COVID: I was at an event in Kuala Lumpur when COVID lockdown started.</p>
<p>Hackathons never went away completely, but they definitely dimmed. Happily, they seem to be coming back in style, and while the concept is perhaps not quite as exciting or cool as it was, in some ways the events are better. The frenetic commercial energy of Digital Transformation has faded. The hackers, at least in the subsurface domain, are much more savvy: there‚Äôs data everywhere and everyone knows what an API is. There are far more packages and tools to choose from (with ChatGPT to find them). It‚Äôs become easier to take time out from the office. And while many of the folks who wanted or needed to find their digital feet have achieved their goals, the end of petroleum looms ever larger and I sense that more people see opportunity in it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm on my way home from a hackathon right now, my first one for about a year. It was wonderful, just like always. Lots of first-timers, which I love to see, and lots of brilliant ideas. It‚Äôs absolutely the best possible way to spend time with colleagues. If you haven‚Äôt experienced it, you should organize one at your place of work. <a href="https://hackmd.io/dUYWLDDISnOwjEVAwdZKJg">Here‚Äôs how.</a> Go on, I dare you üöÄ</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-invitation">An invitation</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre not quite ready to host one, come and experience one instead. <a href="https://www.npd.no/en/force/events/in-person--the-npd-language-modelling-hackathon-2023/">The FORCE Language Modeling Hackathon</a> is happening in Stavanger, Norway, on 30 November and 1 December 2023. I‚Äôm stoked to be hosting, with Peter Bormann organzing. The plan is to fine-tune some language models with open subsurface data from the Norwegian shelf. <strong>What would you ask a virtual assistant that has read everything about <em>your</em> project?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A lot has happened in the 413 days since <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2022/8/29/a-machine-learning-safety-net">my last blog post</a>.</strong></p>
<p>With my colleagues, I shut down <a href="https://agilescientific.com">Agile</a> in September. With my family, I packed up my house in October and moved to Norway in November. With my new colleagues, I found my feet in <a href="https://equinor.com">Equinor</a> in December, and that adventure continues.</p>
<p>Having started my career as a geologist, then reconfigured as a geophysicist, I‚Äôm proud to call myself <em>a developer</em> today. I still have tons to learn about maintaining large projects in an enterprise setting, but I do make things and I consider that to be the killer feature of any hacker.</p>
<p>A few people have asked me what it‚Äôs like to have a boss again, or work inside a big corporation. But really, it‚Äôs not that different from working with corporate clients. I still have a lot of self-determination, thanks to the progressive style of the awesome team I work in, and the only thing I really miss is being able to decide for myself that I‚Äôd like to spend $10k on a hackathon.</p>
<p>Life outside work is full of hikes and bikes, far-flung fjords and cosy cabins. My Norwegian is a bit rusty (my wife and I lived here in the nineties) but basically functional. We found a house to live in, though it did require some downsizing.</p>
<p>In case you hadn‚Äôt noticed, this blog post is more of a postcard to the many friends and co-conspirators I‚Äôve completely failed to keep in touch with. With luck, the coming months and years will provide many opportunities to catch up in person.</p>
<p><strong>For now though‚Ä¶ the blog is back! Scien‚úñÔ∏èlab is here üöÄ</strong></p>
